# About

This project is designed as a Progressive Web App.  This means that the project is compatible with most computer web browsers, tablets, and mobile devices while not requiring licensing with Google or Apple to be deployed through their stores.

It consists of a Web Server component and a Database component.  The Web Server component is used to display a user interface and reporting.  The Database component is used to hold the data of interest.

Core web development technologies include:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * PHP 7

Libraries/Frameworks used:
  * Bootstrap v.3.3.7 [Stable]
    * Bootstrap coding resources:

      http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#input-groups

      https://www.w3schools.com/Bootstrap/default.asp

  * jQuery-3

# How to Install (Ubuntu Server)

  * Step 1 - Create /var/www/html folder and set permissions

    sudo mkdir /var
    sudo mkdir /var/www
    sudo mkdir /var/www/html
    sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html

  * Step 2 - Clone the repository

    cd /var/www/html
    sudo git clone https://github.com/PREngineer/Sprinter
    cd Sprinter

  * Step 3 - Run the installer

    sudo ./install.sh



# Important Considerations:

  * Links do not work like they do normally!
    The links' "href" property has been removed and replaced by a "link" property that is read by
    the JavaScript link handler function.
    This is done because we do not want a complete reload of a new page.  We just care about
    replacing the content of a DIV that represents the content of the pages.  We want to maintain the same navigation menu and footer.
    This also allows for better management of code in different locations without having a
    negative effect on others.
	This also prevents the PWA from opening links in Safari (iOS).
